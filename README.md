# Dice-Game
A 2 player game where each player rolls dice to try to get to 100 total points.

To launch, double click index.html

To play:

Each player can click the "roll dice" button as many times as they want on their turn, but rolling a 1 will end their turn and cause them to lose the points they've accumulated for that turn.

To "save" the points from that turn, click the "hold" button. This will move the points from the "current" score for that turn to the total score.

First player to 100 wins!
